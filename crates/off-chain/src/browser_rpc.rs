//! Polling JSON-RPC methods for browser clients, served over ordinary server-authenticated TLS
//! (see `stoffel_mpc_coordinator_shared::rpc::start_coord_browser_tls`) instead of the mutual
//! TLS the rest of this crate uses.
//!
//! The native transport authenticates a client once per connection, at the TLS handshake, by
//! requiring and verifying a client certificate. A browser's `WebSocket` API has no equivalent:
//! there is no way for page script to present a TLS client certificate. So instead, every
//! method here takes a `SignedBrowserRequest` and authenticates it individually, at the
//! application layer: the browser signs `method || execution_id || created || nonce ||
//! sha256(body) || session_token` with a P-256 keypair it fully controls (see the
//! `stoffel-wasm-client` crate), and `authenticate` verifies that signature and rejects a
//! request whose `created` timestamp has aged out of a short freshness window, or whose
//! `nonce` (16 CSPRNG-random bytes, fresh per request) has already been seen within that same
//! window - the pattern RFC 9421 (HTTP Message Signatures) itself defines for this: `created`
//! bounds how long a request stays valid and lets the server forget old nonces, `nonce` is
//! what actually prevents replay within that window. `session_token` is always present -
//! resolved via one prior WebAuthn ceremony (see `browser_bind_webauthn_identity`), which is
//! also what gates the execution's roster before any of this authentication state is ever
//! allocated. The resulting `ClientIdentity` is exactly the same kind of value the native path
//! derives from a certificate -- the DER-encoded public key -- so it plugs directly into the
//! same `CoordinatorRPCServerConnectionBase`/`CoordinatorRPCServerSharedBase` state the native
//! transport uses. Confidentiality and server authentication come from the TLS layer
//! underneath, same as any ordinary `wss://` site; client authentication comes from this
//! module instead of from the handshake.
